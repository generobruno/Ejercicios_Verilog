TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.066 ns between u_ctrl/stored_A_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uut/o_alu_Result_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.205 ns between u_ctrl/stored_A_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uut/o_alu_Result_reg[0]_lopt_replica/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
